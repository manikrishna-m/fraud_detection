### üîç Project Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for fraud detection, encompassing data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components

* **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning and preparing transaction data for analysis.
* **Model Development**: Employs machine learning algorithms to build models that can detect fraudulent transactions.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
* **Deployment**: Includes steps for deploying the model into a production environment for real-time fraud detection.([GitHub][1])

### üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files:

* `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
* `notebooks/`: Houses Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
* `src/`: Contains source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
* `app.py`: The main application file for the deployed model.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
* `setup.py`: Script for setting up the project environment.
* `Dockerfile`: Configuration file for containerizing the application.
* `template.py`: A template script for model training and evaluation.([GitHub][2])

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manikrishna-m/fraud_detection.git
   cd fraud_detection
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This will start the fraud detection application, allowing you to interact with the model.
